                    <p>An IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the internet, such as our web servers,
                        know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the site the user wishes to view.
                        We collect session data because it helps us analyze such things as what items visitors are
                        likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the site, how many visitors are
                        surfing to various pages on the site, how long visitors to the site are staying and how often
                        they are visiting. It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better
                        administer our systems.</p>

                    <p>Although such information does not identify any visitor personally, it is possible to determine
                        from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP), and the approximate geographic
                        location of his or her point of connectivity.</p>
